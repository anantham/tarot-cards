# Tarot Cards - See Yourself in the 22 Arcana

An interactive tarot card generator inspired by **Lord of the Mysteries**, where you can see yourself depicted in all 22 Major Arcana positions—just like Emperor Roselle's legendary cards.

## 🎴 Concept

Inspired by the web novel *Lord of the Mysteries*, where Emperor Roselle created tarot cards depicting himself in each divine pathway (The Fool, Black Emperor, Red Priest, etc.), this project brings that concept to life.

### Your Personal Tarot Deck

Generate a complete set of 22 animated tarot cards featuring **you** as the protagonist in each archetypal role:

- **Default**: Pre-filled with Aditya's personal journey through 22 life roles and vocations
- **Customizable**: Upload your own photo to generate your personalized deck
- **Multiple Traditions**: Choose from Lord of the Mysteries pathways, traditional Rider-Waite, Egyptian, Celtic, or Shinto interpretations

### Card Features

Each card includes:

1. **AI-Generated Imagery**: Your photo composed into the tarot archetype
2. **AI Video Generation**: Generates 8-second cinematic videos for each card using Google's **Veo 3.1** model (replacing static GIFs).
3. **Personal Lore**: Custom narrative about what that archetype means in your life
4. **Multiple Interpretations**: Switch between cultural/spiritual traditions
5. **Customizable Prompts**: Full control over the AI generation style

## ✨ Experience

### 3D Shuffled Deck Visualization

Cards float in 3D space like a mystical deck in motion:

- **Dynamic Shuffling**: Wild, chaotic animations where you glimpse individual cards
- **Floating & Drifting**: Cards gently bob and rotate in 3D space
- **Hover Interactions**: Cards orient toward you and whisper keywords
- **Touch Controls**: Full 3D experience on mobile with gesture support

### Card Interaction Flow

1. **Shuffled deck** floating dramatically in 3D space
2. **Pick/click a card** to select it
3. **Card flips and expands** with smooth animations
4. **View full details**: Cinematic video, lore, keywords, meanings, abilities

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js + React Three Fiber + Drei
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **AI Generation**: OpenRouter API (Gemini Pro, GPT-4o Mini, etc.)
- **Video Generation**: Google Gemini API (Veo 3.1)
- **Image Processing**: Custom video handling and asset management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- **OpenRouter API Key**: For image generation ([get one here](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Required specifically for **Veo** video generation.

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will open at http://localhost:3000

## ⚙️ Configuration & Costs

The app is highly configurable via `src/data/tarot-config.json`. This file controls:

*   **Prompt Composition**: How the AI prompt is built using lore, deck context, and visual framing instructions.
*   **Cost Estimation**:
    *   **Image**: ~$0.003/image (Gemini Flash)
    *   **Video**: Uses Google's Veo 3.1 (Preview).
    *   *Note: Costs are estimates and depend on the specific model and provider.*

**Default Settings:**
*   Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
*   Frames: 4 (for legacy sprite sheets) or Single Image + Video
*   Provider: Gemini or OpenRouter

## 🎴 Multi-Deck System

The project now supports deep lore customization. All deck data is located in `src/data/`.

*   **`tarot-decks.json`**: The core database. Contains definitions for every card across multiple interpretations (Lord of Mysteries, Egyptian, Celtic, etc.).
*   **`tarot-config.json`**: Global settings for prompt engineering and API handling.

**To add a new deck:**
1.  Add a new entry to `deckTypes` in `tarot-decks.json`.
2.  Add the corresponding key (e.g., `"cyberpunk"`) to every card object in `cards`.

## 🛠️ Scripts

*   **`npm run add-narratives`** (`scripts/add-narratives.cjs`):
    *   A utility script that merges rich narrative descriptions (summary, axis, feeling, scene) into your `tarot-decks.json` file.
    *   Useful if you want to reset or update the core card lore without manually editing the huge JSON file.

## 🔍 Sample Card

A sample output image is available at `public/samplecard.jpeg` for quick reference (visual style example).

3. Upload your photo
4. Choose a deck type (Lord of the Mysteries recommended!)
5. **Generate ONE card first** to test your photo and prompt
6. Refine as needed, then generate all 22

  "personalLore": "FILL THIS: Your story for this card...",
  "lordOfMysteries": {
    "pathway": "Fool Pathway",
    "prompt": "Your custom prompt for AI generation..."
  }
