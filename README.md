# Tarot Cards - Interactive Portfolio

An interactive tarot-inspired portfolio where each Major Arcana card represents a different archetype, era, or project cluster.

## Concept

### Major Arcana as Personal Archetypes

Each of the 22 Major Arcana cards represents one facet of identity paired with a specific era or project cluster:

- **The Fool** as Adi
- **Justice** as Adi
- **The Hermit** as Adi
- _...and so on_

### Card Structure

Each card is a combination of:

1. **Visual**: Illustration / photo / stylized portrait
2. **Lore**: Short narrative about that archetype in your life
3. **Links**: Projects, notes, and artifacts from that mode/era

## Experience

### Shuffled Deck Visualization

On load, the cards come alive:

- Cards float and drift like a slow flock in 2D or 3D space
- They occasionally bump, rotate, and reveal keywords
- **Hover**: Card subtly orients toward cursor and whispers a word ("risk", "alignment", "grief", etc.)
- **Click**: Card flips into a full-screen "room" with its complete story and related links

### Portfolio Integration

The tarot deck appears as a portal within the main portfolio site:

- Single "portal card" in the project graph
- Unique physics (more floaty, slow spin)
- Clicking opens: **"Enter the Deck"** → separate tarot world
- Keeps main portfolio focused while acknowledging this richer, experimental side

## Future Possibilities

- AR integration for physical card interactions
- Pure web experience as foundation
- Expandable to include Minor Arcana for smaller projects/moments

_A living portfolio that shuffles, drifts, and reveals itself card by card._
